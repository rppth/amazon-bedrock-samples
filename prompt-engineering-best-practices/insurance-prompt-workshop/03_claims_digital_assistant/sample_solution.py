Prompt:
Here is the transcript of a customer service call:

<call_log>
{$CALL_LOG}
</call_log>

Please carefully analyze the transcript above, focusing on how the customer's sentiment evolves from
the beginning of the call to the end as the agent works to address their issue.

Think through your analysis step-by-step in a <scratchpad>:
- Break the call down into four equal segments
- For each segment, describe the key events and interactions that occur
- Assess the customer's sentiment during that segment
- Compare the customer's sentiment in the 4th quarter of the call to the 1st quarter and determine
if it improved or worsened

After you've thought it through, please provide your final analysis in the following JSON format:

<json>
{
"quarter1": {
"sentiment": "",
"call_summary": ""
},
"quarter2": {
"sentiment": "",
"call_summary": ""
},
"quarter3": {
"sentiment": "",
"call_summary": ""
},
"quarter4": {
"sentiment": "",
"call_summary": ""
},
"sentiment_change": "",
"action_items": []
}
</json>

The JSON should contain these elements:
- quarter1 through quarter4: Sentiment analysis and summary for each quarter of the call
- sentiment_change: An assessment of whether the customer's sentiment improved or worsened from the
1st to 4th quarter
- action_items: A list of any next steps or action items mentioned on the call to resolve the
customer's issue

Enclose your final JSON output in <result> tags. Remember, do not modify the input call log in any
way. Simply analyze it and provide your findings in the specified JSON format.
