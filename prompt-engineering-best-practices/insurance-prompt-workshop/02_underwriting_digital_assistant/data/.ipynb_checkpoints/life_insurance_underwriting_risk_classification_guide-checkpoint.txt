The Role of Underwriters:  Underwriters play a critical role in assessing the risk associated with 
life insurance applicants. It's our responsibility to evaluate applications thoroughly and fairly, 
ensuring that we provide appropriate coverage to clients while protecting our compan y's 
financial stability.  
The Importance of Risk Classification:  Risk classification is the foundation of underwriting. 
Accurate classification helps us determine premium rates, policy terms, and whether to approve 
or decline applications. Effective risk classification minimizes adverse selection, ensures 
fairness, and  helps maintain the financial health of Main Street Life Insurance.  
Fair and Consistent Underwriting:  It's essential to maintain consistency in underwriting 
decisions. We should evaluate each applicant objectively, considering all relevant information.
